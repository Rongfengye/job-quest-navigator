  2. Help evaluate their soft skills and cultural fit
  3. Follow the format of "Tell me about a time when..." or similar open-ended behavioral question
  4. Be specific enough to elicit a detailed STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) response`;

  3. Help assess their fit for this specific role

      ],
      "improvementPlan": "A paragraph with specific suggestions for how the candidate can improve their interview skills",
      "overallScore": 80
    }
  }
  
  For the individual response scores and overall score, use a scale of 0-100 where:
  - 90-100: Exceptional response
  - 80-89: Strong response
  - 70-79: Good response 
  - 60-69: Average response
  - Below 60: Needs improvement
  
  Be constructive, specific, and actionable in your feedback. Focus on the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result), specificity, relevance to the job, and communication skills.`;
