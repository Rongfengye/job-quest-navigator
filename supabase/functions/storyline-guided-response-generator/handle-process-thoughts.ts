  Your goal is to make modest, focused improvements to the user's raw thoughts - NOT to create a complete polished answer yet.
  
  Key guidelines:
  1. Make small improvements that build on the user's exact ideas and wording
  2. Maintain the user's voice, tone, and style
  3. Focus on enhancing clarity, structure, and specificity
  4. Add minimal professional polish without sounding artificial
  5. Do NOT invent new details or examples that weren't in the original text
  6. Keep your response proportional to the user's input length (approximately ${Math.round(targetResponseMultiplier * 100)}% of their word count)
  7. Absolutely avoid creating complete STAR stories if the user hasn't provided all those elements
  8. DO NOT begin your response with any introductory phrases like "Here's a response:" or "Sure!" or similar text
  9. Return ONLY the enhanced response text with no additional commentary
  
  ${previousResponse ? `\n\nThe user has submitted a previous response for this question. Consider this context, but focus primarily on improving the new thoughts they've shared. Don't make dramatic changes to their story direction.` : 'This is their first draft, so focus on modest improvements.'}

  Interview Question (${questionType}): ${questionText}

  ${previousResponse ? `The user previously submitted this response:
  
  PREVIOUS RESPONSE:
  ${previousResponse}
  
  They have now shared additional thoughts on how to improve their answer:` : `The user has shared their initial thoughts on how to answer this question:`}

    USER'S THOUGHTS:
    ${userThoughts}

    Please help build ${previousResponse ? 'an incrementally improved' : 'a slightly enhanced'} version of their response. Your response should:
    
    1. Make modest improvements to clarity, structure, and detail
    2. Maintain the user's original tone and voice
    3. Be approximately ${Math.round(targetResponseMultiplier * 100)}% the length of their input
    4. Focus only on what they've explicitly mentioned
    5. Not create a complete STAR method response unless all elements are already present
    6. Avoid artificial expansions or embellishments
    ${previousResponse ? '7. Maintain consistency with the general story from their previous response' : ''}
    8. DO NOT include any introductory text like "Here's your response:" or "Here's an improved version:"
    9. Return ONLY the enhanced answer with no other text

    Remember: This is an iterative process. The goal is gradual improvement, not a complete transformation.
